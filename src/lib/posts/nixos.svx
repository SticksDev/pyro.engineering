## Prologue
---
In the ever-evolving world of gaming, infrastructure reliability and scalability are crucial. At Pyro, we have embraced NixOS, a powerful and flexible Linux distribution, to enhance our global gaming infrastructure. This strategic decision has enabled us to automatically configure systems with our software and scale our operations at an unprecedented speed.

## The Challenges of Global Gaming Infrastructure
Running a global gaming network presents unique challenges. The infrastructure must handle massive amounts of data, provide low-latency connections across different geographical regions, and ensure that updates and patches do not disrupt service. Traditional infrastructure management tools often fall short in meeting these demands due to their complexity and the manual intervention required to maintain consistency across servers.
